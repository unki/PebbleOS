//! Button lock: holding Back+Down for a configurable duration
//! (shell_prefs_get_button_lock_hold_ms, 0 = disabled) locks all button and
//! touch input; holding the combo again unlocks.
//!
//! The locked state is intentionally RAM-only: a reboot always unlocks. The
//! hardware reset combo is handled at ISR level in the button driver and is
//! unaffected by the lock.
//!
//! The lock can also engage on its own after shell_prefs_get_button_lock_auto_ms
//! of inactivity. Auto-lock requires a configured hold duration, since without
//! the combo the lock could never be released, and it only ever arms after the
//! first activity following boot, so a fresh boot is always usable.

//! Create resources used by the button lock. Called from shell_event_loop_init.
